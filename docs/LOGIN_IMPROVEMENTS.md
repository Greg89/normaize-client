# Login Screen Improvements

## Overview
The login screen has been completely redesigned to provide a better user experience and proper security. The app now properly restricts access to all functionality when users are not authenticated.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Login Screen
- **Split Layout**: The login screen now has a two-column layout on larger screens
  - Left side: Login form with logo and branding
  - Right side: Recent improvements showcase
- **Modern Design**: Gradient background and improved styling
- **Logo Integration**: Placeholder logo with instructions for replacement
- **Recent Improvements Section**: Highlights new features and updates

### 2. Proper Authentication Flow
- **Complete App Protection**: The entire app (navigation, search bar, content) is now inaccessible when not authenticated
- **Automatic Redirects**: Users are automatically redirected to login when not authenticated
- **No Partial Access**: Users can no longer access the search bar or navigation when logged out

### 3. Logo Setup
- **Full Logo**: Located at `/public/logo.svg` - used on the login page
- **Icon**: Located at `/public/icon.svg` - used in the app sidebar navigation
- **Current Implementation**: Full logo on login, icon in app header

## Logo Files

### Current Setup
- **`/public/logo.svg`**: Full logo with "NormAIze" text (360x62px)
- **`/public/icon.svg`**: Icon-only version (48x48px) for compact display

### Usage
- **Login Page**: Uses the full logo with proper scaling
- **App Header**: Uses the icon next to the app name
- **Responsive Design**: Logos scale appropriately on different screen sizes

### Option 2: Use a different image format
1. Add your logo files to the `/public/` directory:
   - Full logo: `/public/logo.png` (or .jpg, .webp)
   - Icon: `/public/icon.png` (or .jpg, .webp)
2. Update the `src` attributes in the following files:
   - `src/pages/Login.tsx` (line with `<img src="/logo.svg"`)
   - `src/components/Layout.tsx` (line with `<img src="/icon.svg"`)

### Option 3: Use external URLs
1. Update the `src` attributes in both files mentioned above to point to your external logo URLs

## Recent Improvements Section

The right side of the login screen showcases recent improvements to the app. You can customize this section by editing the content in `src/pages/Login.tsx`. The current improvements shown are:

1. **Enhanced Data Processing**: Improved normalization algorithms
2. **New Visualization Features**: Advanced charting capabilities
3. **Enhanced Security**: Better authentication and data protection

## Technical Implementation

### App.tsx Changes
- Added authentication state checking at the app level
- Conditional rendering of Layout component based on authentication status
- Automatic routing to login for unauthenticated users

### Layout.tsx Changes
- Added logo to the sidebar navigation
- Improved visual hierarchy with logo integration

### Login.tsx Changes
- Complete redesign with modern UI
- Added recent improvements showcase
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Security Benefits

1. **Complete App Isolation**: No part of the app is accessible without authentication
2. **No Information Leakage**: Users cannot see navigation structure or search functionality when logged out
3. **Proper Session Management**: Authentication state is properly managed at the app level
4. **Automatic Redirects**: Seamless user experience with automatic login redirects

4. **Social Login** options
